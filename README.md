# NRTI
The purpose of this repository is to test and roll out GITHUB across NRTI. I want to know if it can be used for group projects. Of course this is meaningful for distributive collaborative projects like IUT2019. Plese feel free to contact mathaifenn@gmail.com if you need anything. Utkarsh Tripathi has offered to volunteer for rolling out GitHub at NRTI
